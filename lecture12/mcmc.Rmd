# 1. Random walk on graph

We consider the simple random walk on the following graph.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("graph.png")
```

The transition matrix $P$ for the simple random walk is as follows.

```{r graph RW transition matrix}
edges <- list(c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(2, 3), c(2, 4), c(3, 4), c(3, 5))
P <- make_rw_transition_matrix(5, edges, FALSE)
P
```

Recall from the previous lecture that the stationary distribution can be found using the formula $\pi(k) = \frac{\text{deg}(k)}{2|E|}$, i.e. we have
$$
\pi = (1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/6, 1/12)
$$
We can approximate the stationary distribution by taking a high matrix power.
```{r graph RW stationary distribution}
P %^% 50
```
We now sample a trajectory from this chain and plot it.

```{r sample from trajectory}
T <- 100
trajectory <- sample_trajectory(T, P, 1)
plot_trajectory(trajectory)
```


```{r space and time averages, cache=TRUE}
T <- 200
M <- 200
trajectories <- matrix(0, M, T+1)
for (m in 1:M) {
  trajectories[m, ] <- sample_trajectory(T, P, 1)
}
```


```{r time average}
table(trajectories[, T+1]) / M
```

```{r space average}
table(trajectories[1, ]) / (T+1)
```

# 2. Metropolis-Hastings filter for random walk on graph

We consider the same graph as in Part 1, but now our target distribution is
$$
\pi = \left(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5\right).
$$
```{r mh space and time averages, cache=TRUE}
target <- c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
T <- 200
M <- 200
trajectories <- matrix(0, M, T+1)
for (m in 1:M) {
  trajectories[m, ] <- sample_mh_trajectory(T, P, 1, target)
}
```


```{r mh time average}
table(trajectories[, T+1]) / M
```

```{r mh space average}
table(trajectories[1, ]) / (T+1)
```
We observe that the chain takes longer to converge to the stationary distribution. Since we are working with a finite state space chain, we can also write an updated transition matrix.

```{r mh transition matrix}
Q <- make_mh_transition_matrix(P, target)
Q
```

```{r}
print(Q %^% 50)
print(Q %^% 100)
print(Q %^% 500)
```
